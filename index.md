Hi, my name is Seunghoon Hwang. I am a roboticist specializing in exoskeleton robots designed to rehabilitate the motor abilities of individuals with neurological impairments. At the intersection of biomechanics and robotic control theory, I develop control frameworks that incorporate information on human motor control. My current research focuses on characterizing the mechanical impedance of human joints, which is a fundamental property of the human neuromuscular system that enables smooth, dynamic interactions with the physical environment and developing safety-critical control systems to ensure user safety. By combining these areas, I aim to develop biomimetic controllers for exoskeleton robots that can effectively promote neuroplasticity of neurologically impaired individuals.
